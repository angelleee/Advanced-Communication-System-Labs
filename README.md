Advanced Communication System Simulations and Experiments (MATLAB)

---

### Lab 2 – Signals and the Fourier Transform
Studied discrete-time sinusoidal signals, DFT/FFT, spectral interpretation, zero-padding, and windowing.  
Explored time–frequency duality and frequency resolution.

### Lab 3 – LTI Systems and Their Responses
Implemented convolution, FIR/IIR systems using difference equations, and analyzed frequency responses via poles and zeros.  
Designed lowpass filters using zero–pole placement and DFT-based methods.

### Lab 4 – Analog Modulation
Simulated real and complex carrier modulation and demodulation.  
Demonstrated equivalence between passband systems and complex baseband representations.

### Lab 5 – Digital Modulation
Built baseband digital communication chains including symbol mapping, pulse shaping, matched filtering, sampling, detection, and demapping.

### Lab 6 – Sampling and Rate Conversion
Investigated sampling theory, interpolation, and decimation.  
Analyzed aliasing and reconstruction errors.

### Lab 7 – Transmit Filtering & Upconversion I
Designed transmit pulse shaping filters and performed digital-to-analog style waveform generation.

### Lab 8 – Transmit Filtering & Upconversion II
Extended transmitter modeling including practical waveform shaping and carrier modulation.

### Lab 9 – Receive Filtering & Downconversion
Implemented coherent downconversion and matched filtering at the receiver.

### Lab 10 – RF Impairments
Simulated non-ideal RF effects such as carrier frequency offset, phase offset, and amplitude imbalance.

### Lab 11 – Equalization
Implemented equalizers to mitigate channel distortion.

### Lab 12 – Constant Envelope Modulation
Studied constant-envelope modulation schemes and their spectral and power properties.

### Lab 14 – Fixed-Point Implementation
Evaluated finite-word-length effects on system performance.
